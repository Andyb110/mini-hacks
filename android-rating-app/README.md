# Rating App

Simple rating application to showcase:

- Map/reduce queries to aggregate data using the groupLevel API
- Document APIs to display the number of conflicting revisions in a Document
- The Couchbase Lite Listener for P2P replications

You can also sync the database to Sync Gateway running locally or in the cloud. This illustrates the hybrid approach 
in using P2P capabilities and Sync Gateway in the same application.
